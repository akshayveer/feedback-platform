# Feedback Platform

This application is used by product managers to get feedback from their customers

Product Manager will sign up with google and pay some credit.
Then he creates a feedback form and uploads list of email addresses to which he wants to send survey.

Our platform will mail survey to all those customers and get their feedback.

Consolidate the feedback and present it to product manager
